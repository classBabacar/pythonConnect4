# Inspiration 

Connect4 is one of my favorite games. Growing up, I played this game soo much with family and friends. Repeatedly, losing made me obsessed with the game because I hate losing. So from a programming standpoint, this program was a no-brainer.

I watched this video by Keith Galli: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMLtza3CZFM&t=383s

He explained the idea on how to approach creating a connect4 game with a computer.
